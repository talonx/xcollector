# Configuration file for collecting metrics from Go processes using the expvar mechanism.
# https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/
# The configuration requires an endpoint at which the /debug/vars endpoint can be accessed.
# You can specify just the host:port or the full URL. In the former case /debug/vars will be appended to the host port
#
# Metrics will be collected according to the following rules
# 1. All memory metrics except 'BySize' and the boolean flags (which are unused or always the same value) are collected
# 2. All custom metrics published via expvar are collected in the following manner
#   a) If the metric is a simple number, it is sent to xcollector as-is (i.e. metric-name value)
#   b) If the metric is a map, the map is traversed recursively until we find (a). Such metrics are written to xcollector
#     after constructing the metric name by appending the parent names separated by a dot.
#     E.g. for the debug vars output
#     "hits": 34,
#     "stats":
#       {"connections":
#            {
#             "closed": 748,
#             "opened": 800
#            },
#       "sockets": 800
#      }
#
#   The metrics collected will be
#   hits 1527091857 34
#   stats.sockets 1527091857 800
#   stats.connections.opened 1527091857 800
#   stats.connections.closed 1527091857 748
